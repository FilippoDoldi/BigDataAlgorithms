Collection of Big Data Algorithms-Universit√† degli Studi di Milano (Sep 2021 -- Jan 2021)
A series of algorithms implemented in R and Spark written at UniMi. The focus is on Big Data Analysis techniques, notably:

-research of similar images from a huge dataset using the Locality-Sensitive Hashing with AND/OR amplification.
-recommendation system on a bipartite large graph using both Collaborative Filtering and PageRank with teleport.
-research of dense communities in a large graph with the Sweep algorithm.
-counting items frequencies in a Data Stream through Hash functions.
-simulation of a clinical trial with Bandit algorithms.
