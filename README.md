# Collection of Big Data Algorithms

A series of algorithms implemented in R and Spark written at UniMi. The focus is on Big Data Analysis techniques, notably:

-research of similar images from a huge dataset using the Locality-Sensitive Hashing with AND/OR amplification.

-recommendation system on a bipartite large graph using both Collaborative Filtering and PageRank with teleport.

-research of dense communities in a large graph with the Sweep algorithm.

-counting items frequencies in a Data Stream through Hash functions.

-simulation of a clinical trial with Bandit algorithms.
